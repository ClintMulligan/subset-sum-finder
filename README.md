# subset-sum-finder
A Branch-and-Bound technique that is selective about nodes to create in an attempt to solve the Subset Sum Problem quickly.

To run program:

1. Have installed Nodejs 10.0 or better
2. Have installed NPM
3. Download and unzip project folder.
4. Open a terminal up inside the subset-sum-finder folder, or Change Directory to the subset-sum-finder folder.
5. Use the command "npm start"

The program will run in the terminal, asking you for a set of integers and target sum.

Note: Be sure the list of integers is in similair format number comma number comma... no trailing comma.

You may use positives, signed negatives, zeroes, duplicates and be unordered. (The array is sorted before processing math)
