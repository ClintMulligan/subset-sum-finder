# subset-sum-finder
A Branch-and-Bound technique that is selective about nodes to create in an attempt to solve the Subset Sum Problem quickly.

To run program:

1. Have installed Nodejs 10.0 or better
2. Have installed NPM
3. Download and unzip project folder.
4. Open a terminal up inside the SSF folder, or Change Directory to the SSF folder.
5. Use the command "npm start"

The program will run in the terminal, asking you for a set of integers and target sum.
Note: Be sure the list of integers are number-comma... no trailing comma.
You may use negatives, zero, duplicates and unordered. (The array is sorted before processing math)
